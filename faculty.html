	  Lara Lloret Iglesias obtained her Ph.D. in particle physics at the University of Oviedo working on the search for the Higgs boson. Then she worked as a postdoc in the
	  'Laboratory of Instrumentation and Particle Physics', in Lisbon, conducting supersymmetry searches within the CMS experiment of the LHC, at CERN. From 2015 to 2017, she
	  developed the online data acquisition system for the CERN CT-PPS experiment. Since 2017 she is a postdoc researcher at the IFCA Advanced Computing group where she has
	  specialized in the development of Deep Learning applications. She currently directs the Master in Data Science organized by the University of Cantabria and the UIMP.

	  Dr. Jordi Duarte-Campderros' scientific interests broadly lies in the physics frontier of the Elementary Particle Physics (EPP) field. His main research lines lies
	  in the study of potential new phenomena in EPP and R&D of technology to detect particles in EPP experiments. He is currently working on the characterization and study
	  of new extreme radiation-tolerant pixel sensors prototypes, which are potential candidates to be mounted on the tracker detectors of the CMS upgrade project for the
	  High Luminosity LHC. In addition, he is interested in new sensor technologies to improve granularity in time and position to reconstruct particle trajectories in particularly
	  hostile environments.</br>
	  For the past few years, Duarte-Campderros used data collected by the ATLAS particle detector at CERN to search for long-lived particles, while improved the trajectory
	  reconstruction algorithms of ATLAS to be able to reconstruct such exotic signatures. He started his research career by measuring and studying key electroweak processes using
	  CMS data provided by the LHC, during the initial stage of the machine. In that time he was involved in several Standard Model analysis topics, which include flavor physics,
	  event selection on Higgs searches and production properties of diboson processes WW and WZ .</br>
	  Duarte-Campderros has supervised several undergraduate projects in the Universidad de Cantabria and Tel Aviv University. He is supervisor of CERN Summer Students projects,
	  and he is currently supervising a Ph.D. thesis in the Universidad de Cantabria. He is also co-teaching 1 undergraduate Physics course (Particle Physics) and a section of a
	  master degree physics course at the Universidad de Cantabria.
